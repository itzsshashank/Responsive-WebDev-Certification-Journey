# Web Development Journey

Welcome to my web development journey repository! :rocket:

## Introduction

I'm Shashank Shukla, and I'm on an exciting journey to further develop my skills in web development by [FreeCodeCamp](https://github.com/freecodecamp). I've already taken some initial steps, sharing two basic projects on GitHub showcasing my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS. This repository serves as a place to track my progress and continue exploring the world of web development.

## Future Plans

I'm excited to build on my existing knowledge and take my web development skills to the next level. In the future, I plan to:

- Create more advanced web projects, incorporating JavaScript and other technologies.
- Dive into responsive web design to enhance the user experience.
- Collaborate with others and contribute to open-source projects.
- Explore new frameworks and libraries to expand my toolkit.

## Contact

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashankshukla04/) if you'd like to chat about web development, share tips, or collaborate on projects.

I'm enthusiastic about this journey, and I look forward to sharing my progress and new projects with the community. Stay tuned for more exciting web development endeavors!
